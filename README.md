# Unreal Map Bridge (unreal_map_bridge)

Import real world locations into Unreal Engine

This is the start of a re-write of my current project https://github.com/delebash/unreal_mapbox_bridge

This project is a customized fork of the cool Cities-Skylines heightmap generator.  https://github.com/sysoppl/Cities-Skylines-heightmap-generator

It is a work in progress. The Cities Skylines has some nice code for stitching tiles together, some other cool features, as well as a simple layout. This is why I have decided to use it as a base for my re-write.
